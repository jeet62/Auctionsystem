# Auction System

## Project Description
The Auction System is a smart contract-based decentralized auction platform. It allows participants to place bids in 
real time on a blockchain, ensuring transparency, trust, and immutability in the bidding process.

## Project Vision
To build a secure, fair, and decentralized auction mechanism that eliminates the need for intermediaries, 
enabling global participation with transparent and tamper-proof transactions.

## Key Features
- 🏆 **Highest Bid Tracking**: Automatically updates and stores the highest bid and bidder.
- 🔄 **Refund System**: Automatically refunds outbid participants.
- 🔒 **Auction Control**: Only the owner can end the auction and collect the highest bid.

## Future Scope
- ⏰ Timed Auctions: Add support for auction start and end times.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-item Auctions: Support for multiple items being auctioned simultaneously.
- 📱 DApp Integration: Build a frontend interface for interacting with the auction via Web3.
- 🔗 Oracle Integration: Add external data sources for dynamic pricing or validation.
